# Score Board App
This app, developed in Java using Android Studio, allows users to efficiently track the scores of two teams – Home and Guest. Users can easily add or subtract points from either team and keep a dynamic, real-time tally. Additionally, the app features a "Clear Board" function, which resets both scores to zero with a single tap. The intuitive interface ensures seamless control, making it ideal for any competitive environment where scorekeeping is essential.
